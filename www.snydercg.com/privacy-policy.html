<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Snyder Construction Group (herein referred to as ‚ÄúSnyder Construction Group‚Äù) appreciates that 
privacy is important to you and is committed to protecting the 
confidentiality of Personal Information and handling Personal

applicable law as it exists. Snyder Construction Group understands that laws and 
circumstances may change quicker than the Policy can be adjusted to fit 
and that this Privacy Policy cannot address every possible issue and 
circumstance. As such, this Privacy Policy is subject in all respects to
 local legal and regulatory requirements, as well as existing 
agreements, and Snyder Construction Group confirms that the company will comply with any 
such requirements and existing agreements.</p>

 of mass marketing communications targeted by Personal Information we 
have collected or otherwise obtain consent in the manner required by 
applicable law. These mechanisms will normally be available on the 
relevant email or web site, but you may always notify us at the address 
specified below under ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù. Requests to opt out of 
communications based on data controlled by third parties must be made 
through the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there may be 
some jurisdictions requiring stricter opt-in versus opt-out mechanisms 
relating to these types of communications and we will comply with the 
applicable laws in such locations.</p>
<h2>External Links; Public Social Media</h2>
<p>This Site may provide links to other third party websites, 
including social media sites. These links are provided to you for your

 privacy policies or practices, or the content of such external links or
 the person or entity responsible for them. You should review the 
applicable terms of use and privacy policy provisions of such third 
party websites before using them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any information you submit in a public forum or 
social marketing site that is publicly available (such as a chat room, 
public posting or blog, whether or not sponsored by Snyder Construction Group) can be 
read, collected, or used by us as well as others, and could be used to 
personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you
 choose to submit through these media, and although we attempt to 
monitor user-posted content, such user-posted material is not subject to
 this privacy statement. Use of any Snyder Construction Group-related social media or 
marketing site may also be subject to additional policies and terms of 
use, which you should review before posting any such public information.</p>
<h2>Other Snyder Construction Group Sites</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is applicable to this Site, as specified 
above. However, other Snyder Construction Group websites may have their own respective 
privacy policy or other privacy-related terms posted. Those other 
privacy terms and conditions shall apply to privacy-related issues 
regarding that other site and the use of any services, functionalities 
or other offerings made in connection with that other site, and this 
Privacy Policy shall not apply in such circumstances.</p>
<h2>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Snyder Construction Group may amend this Policy at any time by posting a revised
 version on this Site, without providing prior notice to you. Any such 
amendment will be effective at the time it is posted unless a delayed 
effective date is expressly stated in the revised version. Your 
continued use of this Site after such changes have been posted will 
constitute your acceptance of the changes.</p>
<h2>Enforceability</h2>
<p>In the event any of the provisions of this Privacy Policy shall
 be held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be 
unimpaired, and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced by such

underlying the unenforceable term or provision. This Privacy Policy
